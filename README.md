# StockMarket_Analysis

Above, you will find a VBA file that contains code that can be imported into the Multiple Year Stock Data file. When run, it will provide a new summary table of each year along with an analysis of the stocks that have the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease and the greatest total volume. These tables can be viewed individually by year along with their source data in the yearly tabs as well as seen compiled onto a separate summary tab. 

Along with the VBA code, there are screenshots of each year's tab and the summary tab to see a snippet of what the final product will look like after the code has been run on the workbook.
