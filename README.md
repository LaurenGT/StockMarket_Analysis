# StockMarket_Analysis

Above, you will find a VBA file that contains code that can be run through either the alphabetical testing or multiple year stock data. When run, it will provide a new summary table of each tab along with an analysis of the stocks that have the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease and the greatest total volume on each tab. 

Along with the VBA code, there are screenshots of each year's tab to see a snippet of what the final product will look like after the code has been run on the multiple year stock data.
